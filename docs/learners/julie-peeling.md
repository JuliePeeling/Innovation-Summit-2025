## About Me
- **Name:** Julie Peeling 
- **Affiliation:** Cornell University 
- **Email:** jap479@cornell.edu 

## Research Interests
My research focuses on using remotely sensed vegetation information to identify long-term trends in dryland systems and inform vegetation responses to restoration-focused management. I am really excited to learn more about systems-based thinking in environmental applications as well as incorporating big data to study questions at variable spatial and temporal scales.

## Fun Fact
I learned how to windsurf this summer!
