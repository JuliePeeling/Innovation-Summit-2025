## About Me
- **Name:** Julie Peeling
- **Affiliation:** Cornell University
- **Email:** jap479@cornell.edu

## Research Interests
My research uses remotely sensed vegetation information to understand long-term ecological changes in drylands and how those changes influence vegetation responses to restoration-focused management. I am really excited to learn more about systems thinking for environmental problems and incorporating big data to address questions across variable spatial and temporal scales.

## Fun Fact
I learned how to windsurf this past summer!
