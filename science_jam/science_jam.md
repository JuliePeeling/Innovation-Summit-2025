- [Brainstorming Sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wUEIIDvpyfN7ZSsaT-0M59V2Ph07TT8c?usp=drive_link) - You may keep adding ideas until August 19th. Please do not delete or type over anyone elseâ€™s idea.

## Topics
1. Defining tipping points, (ecological) collapse, and transformation/regime shift
2. Understanding environmental drivers and thresholds of tipping points: climate change, fire, drought, land use change, compound disturbances
3. Understanding social drivers and thresholds of tipping points: social-ecological systems, community vulnerability, and governance 
4. Detecting and predicting tipping points: past and future 
5. Understanding environmental impacts of transformation on ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage, biodiversity, water quality)
6. Understanding social impacts of transformation on people and society
7. Applying management and adaptation strategies for ecosystem resilience

## Products
During the Summit, you will have the opportunity to dive into relevant data to contribute to product, such as:
1. Co-author publications on new methods, syntheses, or perspectives
2. Coâ€‘develop grant proposals
3.  Create resources: educational resources, data products, or workflows that advance open science
4. Formulate strategies to engage stakeholders with tools, guidelines, or applications
